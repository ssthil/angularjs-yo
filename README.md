AngularJS-Yoeman
============

AngularJS development with Yoeman, Grunt and Bower

## AngularJS generator
Yeoman generator for AngularJS - lets you quickly set up a project with sensible defaults and best practises.

## Create new directory
```
$ mkdir angularjs-yo
```
## install yo and other required tools
```
$ npm instal -g yo
```
If you are using npm 1.2.10 or above, this will also automatically install grunt and bower for you. If you're on an older version of npm, you will need to install them manually:
```
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```
## Basic scaffolding
```
$ npm install -g generator-webapp

$ yo webapp
```
## Scaffolding an AngularJS app
```
$ npm install -g generator-angular
$ yo angular
```
